            <h2>THE IRON MAN - Avenger</h2>
            <p><b>Iron Man</b> is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created 
             by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). In 1963, the character founded the Avengers superhero team with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.
             A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist,
             Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors 
             attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of 
             armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons 
             and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the 
             suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his 
             true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.</p>
